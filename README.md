# LinkedIn-Auto-Connect

This is greasemonkey script. For chrome, you may use Tamper Monkey https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en


To use this
1) Import the script to greasemonkey, remember to update the script with your email (used to fill in email in case some connection require you to fill in your email)
2) Login to your LinkedIn
3) Search for the contact with your criteria, try to set only 2nd connection, as you can easily reach out 2nd connection.
4) Once you got the result, press the "Start Auto Connect" button on the top right.
5) Sit and watch the magic.


*NOTE* 
uncomment the line following line if your screen is too small to see everyone connection in one page. I don't use that because I set my zoom ratio for chrome to 50%

**window.scroll(0, 1000);**
